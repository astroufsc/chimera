class DCFocuser (FocuserBase):

    """
    DCFocuser uses as standard DC pulse Focuser with a software
    layer to mimic the behaviour of a Encoder-based Focuser.

    You have to define two parameter:
     - 'dt': define the longest pulse possible to go end-to-end through the focuser.
     - 'pulse_dt': how long would a single unit pulse be.

    NOTE: For APIs which doesn't provide access to time driven focuser
    movements, dt and pulse_dt could be in whatever unit you like, for
    example: dt could be how in units of 'small pulse'. See
    TheSkyTelescope implementation of this class for an example.

    Those two paremeters will define the 'encoded' range of DCFocuser,
    for example: If dt=2000 ms and pulse_dt = 10 ms, this virtual
    encoded focuser would be 2000/10= 200 units (getRange would return
    (0, 200).

    Normally, before use this class you should do a handwork with a
    chronometer and pulse your focuser to one end and then time how
    long it takes to go end-to-en, unless your focuser manufacturer
    give this number for you.
