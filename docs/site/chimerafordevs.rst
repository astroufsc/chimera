Developing for Chimera

Introduction
============

Chimera uses a client/server model coupled with remote procedure call
(RPC) system. Chimera defines all its entities in terms of objects.

To be a valid Chimera object a class must extend
:class:`ChimeraObject` class. :class:`ChimeraObject` class implements
:class:`ILifeCycle` interface which defines basic methods every object
must have to be started and stopped. :class:`ChimeraObject` provides a
basic implementation of a control loop, a common structure in control
programs.

By itself, a Chimera object is just a static bunch of code that 
inherits from a specific class. To be useful, every
:class:`ChimeraObject` must have a :class:`Manager` to manage its life
cycle.

.. note:: 
 We call it instrument, controller or driver purely from a semantic
 point of view, as they are equal from a code point of view, there is
 no different base class for different kinds of objects. Every
 instrument, controller or driver extends :class:`ChimeraObject`. More
 specifically, it must implement :class:`ILifeCycle`, and
 :class:`ChimeraObject` provides us with a basic implementation.

The :class:`Manager` class is responsible for object initialization, life
cycle (start, stop) and proxy creation. :class:`Manager` is also our
server in the client/server model. It's a server of objects. We can
think of :class:`Manager` as a pool of objects available to be used.

As we need RPC support for every object and want to make the system easy
to use and write, we use a Proxy class that handles all the networking
for us. This way, you don't have to write networking code on your
objects, just the real action, Proxy and friends add networking for 
you.

Before describing :class:`Manager`'s responsibilities in more detail,
let's describe all features we can have in a Chimera object.

.. _chimeraobj:

Chimera objects
===============

A Chimera object, as already said, is a normal Python class which extends from
a specific base class, :class:`ChimeraObject`, the simplest
:class:`ChimeraObject` is the following.

.. literalinclude:: simplest.py
   :language: python

this object has no methods, configuration or events, so it's the simplest
and dumbest possible object.  

As Python doesn't call base constructors per se, you need to call the
base constructor from Simplest constructor (:meth:`__init__` method).

Chimera uses the concept of :class:`Location` all over the code. A
Location is much like an URL, but without a scheme. Locations
identify specific class instances running somewhere. The basic
format is the following:

::

   [host:port]/Classname/instance_name[?param1=value1,...]

`host` and `port`, optional fields, tell Chimera where to look for
this particular object. `Classname` is the class name of the object
and `instance_name` the name given to a specific instance running on
host:port. When you add objects to :class:`Manager`, you must specify
a name. Also, you can pass configuration parameters as comma separated
param=value pairs.

Let's write down a class that uses this and see how to actually use
this from Chimera.

.. literalinclude:: example1.py
   :language: python

This example requires some explanations, but before, let's run it
using :command:`chimera` script. :command:`chimera` script is a script
to initialize :class:`Manager` and add objects either from Locations
given on command line or from a configuration file.

To follow Chimera conventions, a file with a class named
:class:`Example1` must be saved to a file name :file:`example1.py` to
allow Chimera ClassLoader to find it. We may simplify this in the future.

You can save this file anywhere on your system, let's suppose you saved
it on your $HOME directory.

To run it, call :command:`chimera` this way:

::

   $ chimera -I $HOME -i /Example1/example

You'll see something like this::

   [date] WARNING chimera.example1 (example1) example1.py:15 Hi, I'm doing something.
   [date] WARNING chimera.example1 (example1) example1.py:16 My arg=test argument
   [date] WARNING chimera.example1 (example1) example1.py:17 My param1=a string parameter

You should use Ctrl+C (SIGINT) to stop :command:`chimera`.

The -I on chimera tells Chimera where to look for instruments, this
case to look in your $HOME directory (you can use any directory there,
'.' for example). Then to -i we pass a valid Chimera Location. From
the Location, Chimera knows that you want to create an instance of
Example1 class and call this instance 'example'.

You can also pass configuration parameters right on the Location given
in the command line. Use::

   $ chimera -I $HOME -i /Example1/example?param1="Now for something different"

A few points need explanation on :class:`Example1`:

 1. :attr:`__config__` is a class attribute (class field in some
 circles) where you should pass a Python dictionary with any parameter
 you like to add to your object. Chimera uses the value you pass in as
 default value and also uses the type of it to do some type checking
 for you. Look at src/chimera/core/config.py for valid types.

 2. :meth:`__start__` method. This method is from :class:`ILifeCycle`
 interface, :class:`ChimeraObject` implementation just does nothing,
 here we use it to call a specific method on object
 initialization. :class:`Manager` first call :meth:`__init__` to
 create an instance, configure this instance passing any parameter you
 gave on command line, then call :meth:`__start__` and when system is
 shutting down call :meth:`__stop__`.

 3. :attr:`log`. :class:`ChimeraObject` implementation give a `log`
 attribute (instance field, in other circles) to every class, you can
 use this to log messages to default Chimera log system. It's a normal
 Python's :mod:`logging` logger, so consult `logging
 <http://docs.python.org/lib/module-logging.html>`_ for more
 information.

 4. :attr:`self["param1"]`. You define your object parameters using
 :attr:`__config__` dict, but to access the actual value, you use the
 current object (self) as dictionary to access values from it. Thus,
 :attr:`self["param1"]` treat `self` as a dict and get key `param1` from
 it. For most purposes, self is a dict and normal dict. You can also
 set things, with normal ``self["param1"] = "value1"``.

When you use :command:`chimera` script, a :class:`Manager` is created
for you, but you can do it by yourself to learn how things work in
Chimera. The following example is based on :file:`server.py`.

.. literalinclude:: server.py
   :language: python

Suppose you save it to :file:`server.py` in the same directory where
you put :file:`example1.py` (this is a not a restriction, just to make
things easier).

::

   $ python server.py


You'll see exactly the same as running :command:`chimera`.

But, as said in the first paragraph of this document Chimera is
client/server, :file:`server.py` shows how to create a server, let's
see how to use it in a client.

.. literalinclude:: client.py
   :language: python

Save it to :file:`client.py`. First run, :file:`server.py` as
explained above and then run :file:`client.py`.

::

   $ python client.py

You will see something like this::

   [date] WARNING chimera.example1 (example1) example1.py:15 Hi, I'm doing something.
   [date] WARNING chimera.example1 (example1) example1.py:16 My arg=test argument
   [date] WARNING chimera.example1 (example1) example1.py:17 My param1=a string parameter
   [date] WARNING chimera.example1 (example1) example1.py:15 Hi, I'm doing something.
   [date] WARNING chimera.example1 (example1) example1.py:16 My arg=client argument
   [date] WARNING chimera.example1 (example1) example1.py:17 My param1=a string parameter

The first three lines are from :meth:`__start__` calling
:meth:`doSomething`, and later three from our client calling it again.

In :file:`client.py`, you see we create a normal :class:`Manager`,
just like in server.py, but we only use this :class:`Manager` to get
access to :class:`Example1` running on other :class:`Manager`
(localhost:8000).

:meth:`Manager.getProxy` returns a :class:`Proxy` object for the
specifies Location. For all purposes this :class:`Proxy` class acts
like the original object, so you can call any method just like you
would with the original object.
