Chimera - Observatory Automation System
=======================================

Installation:

Before installing Chimera, install the following packages using the standard way
on your distribution.

For basic chimera: python-dev python-numpy saods9 sextractor
For SBIG support: libusb-dev swig
For chimera-gui: libcfitsio3-dev python-gtk2-dev python-gobject-dev python-pygoocanvas python-gdl

To enable WCS and pointing verification, install astrometry.net and the required
indices (see www.astrometry.net for information about the indices, which we could
not redistribute).

To run unit tests also install python-nose.

Ubuntu 9.10
===========

Here is the full command line to use on Ubuntu 9.10 to get all the requirements:

sudo apt-get install python-dev python-numpy saods9 sextractor libusb-dev swig \
libcfitsio3-dev python-gtk2-dev python-gobject-dev python-pygoocanvas python-gdl \
python-nose python-epydoc

Notes for Ubuntu 9.04:

Replace python-gdl by python-gnome2-extras.

saods9 packages is broken, so remove it from the list and install
it manually. Chimera needs xpa tools too, it's available on DS9 site as well.
Make sure all this binaries are anywhere on your $PATH.
